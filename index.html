    <p>I'm fifteen for a moment <br>
        Caught in between ten and twenty <br>
        And I'm just dreaming <br>
        Counting the ways to where you are<br> </br>
        I'm twenty two for a moment<br>
        She feels better than ever <br>
        And we're on fire<br>
        Making our way back from Mars<br>
        Fifteen there's still time for you<br></br>
        Time to buy and time to lose<br>
        Fifteen, there's never a wish better than this<br>
        When you only got hundred years to live<br>
        I'm thirty three for a moment<br> </br>
        Still the man, but you see I'm of age<br>
        A kid on the way<br>
        A family on my mind<br>
        I'm forty five for a moment<br></br>
        The sea is high<br>
        And I'm heading into a crisis<br>
        Chasing the years of my life<br>
        Fifteen there's still time for you<br>
        Time to buy, time to lose yourself<br>
        Within a morning star<br>
        Fifteen I'm all right with you<br></br>
        Fifteen, there's never a wish better than this<br>
        When you only got hundred years to live<br>
        Half time goes by<br>
        Suddenly you're wise<br>
        Another blink of an eye<br>
        Sixty seven is gone<br>
        The sun is getting high<br></br>
        We're moving on<br>
        I'm ninety nine for a moment<br>
        Dying for just another moment<br>
        And I'm just dreaming<br>
        Counting the ways to where you are<br>
        Fifteen there's still time for you<br></br>
        Twenty two I feel her too<br>
        Thirty three you're on your way<br>
        Every day's a new day<br>
        Fifteen there's still time for you<br>
        Time to buy and time to choose<br>
        Hey fifteen, there's never a wish better than this<br>
        When you only got hundred years to live<br>
